### Step 1: Install Zotero 

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a free, open source citation manager that works offline. We'll be practicing importing and deduplicating searches. 

1. Go to the [Zotero download page](https://www.zotero.org/download/) and download Zotero 5.0. 
2. From [the same webpage](https://www.zotero.org/download/), download the Zotero connector for your browser of choice. 
3. Register for an online account with Zotero [at this site](https://www.zotero.org/user/register/). Make a note of your username and password and bring that information to class.

### Step 2: Set up a Rayyan account

[Rayyan](https://rayyan.qcri.org/) is an online application for screening studies for a systematic review. We'll be importing our deduplicated searches into Rayyan and practicing the independent screening process.  It's important to do this a couple days before the workshop as the registration process can sometimes be delayed.

1. Go to the [Rayyan website](https://rayyan.qcri.org/). 
2. Click the blue Sign Up button.
3. Fill out the registration form and follow the steps to confirm your account and set up a password.
4. Make a note of your user name and password so you're ready to use Rayyan during the workshop!

### Step 3: Download workshop files

If you haven't already downloaded the files from the MLA website, you can download [this zip file] (https://github.com/rootsandberries/MLA_SR_Workshop/blob/master/systrev/MLA2018_SR_Workshop_files.zip?raw=true) and save it to your desktop for quick access during the workshop. This includes database export files for practice with Zotero and Rayyan and worksheets for in-class exercises.  This file does not include the PowerPoint, which is only available on the MLA website.

### Step 4: Take our pre-workshop survey
